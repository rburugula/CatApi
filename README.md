# CatApi

Libraries used Retrofit - for API calls 
lifecycle-extensions:2.2.0 - For View Model 
Dagger - For dependency injection 
Mockk for mocking

I am using MVVM architecture to develop this application.
I have architected the code in a way that there is seperation of concerns, have created separate packages for Data, repository, DI etc..
UI is very basic in the application, but I have used jetpack navigation component
I have added unit tests to the repository layer and the viewmodel.

Apologies for the project being names DogApi and the internally everything else is Cat related - When I created the application I was intending to use dop api but as the documentation of the catapi was more clear i used that instead.

Please note that UI is very basic and I have not spent too much time on making the UI look fabulous
